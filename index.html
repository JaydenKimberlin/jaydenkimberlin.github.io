            <h3>Guessing Game</h3>
            <p>This game is just about guessing. You guess a number 1-100, and bada bing bada boom, you get the wrong
                answer because that is a retarded range. It's really really
                just self explanatory, if you don't know what this is, then just get outta here. If one wasn’t from
                this class, there’s no explanation needed. You hit the “start
                game” button and then just play. The first version only took a few hours as it was rushed, even with
                the help of a fellow classmate. The second iteration took
                about an hour and a half while working simultaneously with another classmate, all rewritten into the
                guessing game it is now.</p>
            <h4>Here's the final code for the second iteration.</h4>

            <img id="screenshot" height="225px" src="src/codeTwo.PNG" alt="code screenshot">
            <p>The first image is the overall code that made the number guessing game work. It's all the code that
                makes it work. The second image is an important codeblock, as it shows the if and else statements for
                the code whether its true or false. Meaning, if true, you got the correct guess, and it will tell you.
                Then, it adds to your score and returns the real answer aswell. This also compares it to the answer and
                if
                it's the right answer, then it'll print "Just right!". If not, then the code will print that you got it
                wrong,
                subtract from your score and attempts, and say if your guess is too high or too low.
