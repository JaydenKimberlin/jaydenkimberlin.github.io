            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Jayden Kimberlin, I'm 17 years old and I'm a senior in Wayne Memorial High School! I'm a graphic
                designer,
                web developer, and photographer from Wayne, Michigan. I've been designing since 2012, after my mother
                graduated Specs
                Howard. As time progressed, I became more interested in game design and programming, front and back end
                web development,
                and with graphic design I also became wrapped up in amateur photography, doing little jobs for people
                and using it to
                assist me in my graphic design class at career tech. Ever since then, everything that I've learned and
                taught myself
                has really grown into large passions of mine.

            <h3>MTAG Game</h3>
            <p>
                The MTAG game the bigger game we developed in Game Design and Programming. We initally had no clue
                what to call it, so we just called the game "Life: The Game", because this is truly just life.
                If a player plays this game, and has never played it before, I believe it would be very simple to catch
                on.
                I designed the game with my classmates to be really easy to catch onto and play.

            <h3>Guessing Game</h3>
            <p>This game is just about guessing. You guess a number 1-100, and bada bing bada boom, you get the
                wrong
                answer because that is a dumb range. It's really really
                just self explanatory, if you don't know what this is, then just get outta here. If one wasn’t
                from
                this class, there’s no explanation needed. You hit the “start
                game” button and then just play. The first version only took a few hours as it was rushed, even
                with
                the help of a fellow classmate. The second iteration took
                about an hour and a half while working simultaneously with another classmate, all rewritten
                into the
                guessing game it is now.</p>
            <h4>Here's the final code for the second iteration.</h4>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <img src="src/codeOne.PNG" width="100%" alt="code screenshot">
                </div>
                <div class="col-6">
                    <img src="src/codeTwo.PNG" width="100%" alt="code screenshot">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The first image is the overall code that made the number guessing game work. It's all the code
                that
                makes it work. The second image is an important codeblock, as it shows the if and else
                statements for
                the code whether its true or false. Meaning, if true, you got the correct guess, and it will
                tell you.
                Then, it adds to your score and returns the real answer aswell. This also compares it to the
                answer and
                if
                it's the right answer, then it'll print "Just right!". If not, then the code will print that
                you got it
                wrong,
                subtract from your score and attempts, and say if your guess is too high or too low.
