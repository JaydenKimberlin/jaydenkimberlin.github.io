                <h3>Guessing Game</h3>
                <p>This game is just about guessing. You guess a number 1-100, and bada bing bada boom, you get the
                    wrong
                    answer because that is a retarded range. It's really really
                    just self explanatory, if you don't know what this is, then just get outta here. If one wasn’t
                    from
                    this class, there’s no explanation needed. You hit the “start
                    game” button and then just play. The first version only took a few hours as it was rushed, even
                    with
                    the help of a fellow classmate. The second iteration took
                    about an hour and a half while working simultaneously with another classmate, all rewritten
                    into the
                    guessing game it is now.</p>
                <h4>Here's the final code for the second iteration.</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img src="src/codeOne.PNG" width="100%" alt="code screenshot">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img src="src/codeTwo.PNG" width="100%" alt="code screenshot">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The first image is the overall code that made the number guessing game work. It's all the code
                    that
                    makes it work. The second image is an important codeblock, as it shows the if and else
                    statements for
                    the code whether its true or false. Meaning, if true, you got the correct guess, and it will
                    tell you.
                    Then, it adds to your score and returns the real answer aswell. This also compares it to the
                    answer and
                    if
                    it's the right answer, then it'll print "Just right!". If not, then the code will print that
                    you got it
                    wrong,
                    subtract from your score and attempts, and say if your guess is too high or too low.
                </p>
